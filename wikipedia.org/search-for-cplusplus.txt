The [[Semites]] named it [[gimel]]. The sign is possibly adapted from an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] for a [[Staff-sling|staff sling]], which may have been the meaning of the name ''gimel''. Another possibility is that it depicted a camel, the Semitic name for which was ''gamal''. [[Barry B. Powell]], a specialist in the history of writing, states \"It is hard to imagine how gimel = \"camel\" can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Barry B.|title=Writing: Theory and History of the Technology of Civilization|date=27 Mar 2009|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-1405162562|page=182|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PZ2Gr3d9X2UC&pg=PA182&dq=Gimel+shaped+like+a+camel%27s+neck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mnPqUvfRBoWR0AXBg4GICg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Gimel%20shaped%20like%20a%20camel's%20neck&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Etruscan language]], [[plosive consonant]]s had no contrastive [[phonation|voicing]], so the [[Greek language|Greek]] '[[Gamma|\u0393]]' (Gamma) was adopted into the [[Etruscan alphabet]] to represent {{IPA|/k/}}. Already in the [[Western Greek alphabet]], Gamma first took a '[[File:Early Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' form in Early Etruscan, then '[[File:Classical Etruscan C.gif|15px]]' in Classical Etruscan. In Latin it eventually took the '{{smallcaps|c}}' form in Classical Latin. In the earliest [[Latin]] inscriptions, the letters '{{smallcaps|c k q}}' were used to represent the sounds {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (which were not differentiated in writing).  Of these, '{{smallcaps|q}}' was used to represent {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/\u0261/}} before a rounded vowel, '{{smallcaps|k}}' before '{{smallcaps|a}}', and '{{smallcaps|c}}' elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\n|first=Andrew L.\n|last=Sihler\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=1995\n|location=New York\n|ISBN=0-19-508345-8\n|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IeHmqKY2BqoC\n|page=21\n}}</ref>  During the 3rd century BC, a modified character was introduced for {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' itself was retained for {{IPA|/k/}}. The use of '{{smallcaps|c}}' (and its variant '{{smallcaps|g}}') replaced most usages of '{{smallcaps|k}}' and '{{smallcaps|q}}'.  Hence, in the classical period and after, '{{smallcaps|g}}' was treated as the equivalent of Greek gamma, and '{{smallcaps|c}}' as the equivalent of kappa; this shows in the romanization of Greek words, as in 'KA\u0394MO\u03a3', 'KYPO\u03a3', and '\u03a6\u03a9KI\u03a3' came into Latin as '{{smallcaps|cadmvs}}', '{{smallcaps|cyrvs}}' and '{{smallcaps|phocis}}', respectively.\n\nOther alphabets have letters [[homoglyph]]ic to 'c' but not in use and derivation, like the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[Es (Cyrillic)|Es]] (\u0421, \u0441) which derives from the lunate [[sigma (letter)|sigma]], named due to its resemblance to the crescent moon.\n\n==Later use==\nWhen the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, 'c' represented only {{IPA|/k/}} and this value of the letter has been retained in loanwords to all the [[insular Celtic languages]]: in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], 'c' represents only {{IPA|/k/}}. The [[Old English]] or \"[[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]]\" writing was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence 'c' in Old English also originally represented {{IPA|/k/}}; the Modern English words ''kin, break, broken, thick'', and ''seek,'' all come from Old English words written with 'c': ''cyn, brecan, brocen, \u00feicc'', and ''s\u00e9oc''. But during the course of the Old English period, {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels ({{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}) were [[palatalization|palatalized]], having changed by the tenth century to {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, though 'c' was still used, as in ''cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a''. On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on (for example, in [[Italian language|Italian]]).\n\nIn Vulgar Latin, {{IPA|/k/}} became palatalized to {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} in Italy and Dalmatia; in France and the Iberian peninsula, it became {{IPA|[ts]}}. Yet for these new sounds {{angbr|{{sm|c}}}} was still used before front vowels {{angbr|e}},{{angbr| i}}.  The letter thus represented two distinct values. Subsequently, the Latin phoneme {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} (spelled {{angbr|{{smallcaps|qv}}}}) de-labialized to {{IPA|/k/}} meaning that the various Romance languages had {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels.  In addition, [[Norman language|Norman]] used the Greek letter 'k' so that the sound {{IPA|/k/}} could be represented by either 'k' or 'c' the latter of which could represent either {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on whether it preceded a front vowel or not. The convention of using both c' and 'k' was applied to the writing of English after the [[Norman Conquest]], causing a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English ''candel, clif, corn, crop, c\u00fa,'' remained unchanged, ''Cent, c\u00e6\u00b4\u1d79 (c\u00e9\u00b4\u1d79), cyng, brece, s\u00e9oce,'' were now (without any change of sound) spelled 'Kent', 'ke\u021d', 'kyng', 'breke', and 'seoke'; even ''cniht'' ('knight') was subsequently changed to 'kniht' and ''\u00feic'' ('thick') changed to 'thik' or 'thikk'. The Old English 'cw' was also at length displaced by the French 'qu' so that the Old English ''cw\u00e9n'' ('queen') and ''cwic'' ('quick') became [[Middle English]] 'quen' 'quik', respectively. {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} to which Old English palatalized {{IPA|/k/}} had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly from Latin {{IPA|/k/}} before 'a'. In French it was represented by 'ch', as in ''champ'' (from Latin ''camp-um'') and this spelling was introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt. i-iii, ''child, chyld, riche, mychel,'' for the ''cild, rice, mycel,'' of the Old English version whence they were copied. In these cases, the Old English 'c' gave place to 'k qu ch' but, on the other hand, 'c' in its new value of {{IPA|/ts/}} came in largely in French words like ''processiun, emperice, grace,'' and was also substituted for 'ts' in a few Old English words, as ''miltse, bletsien,'' in early Middle English ''milce, blecien''. By the end of the thirteenth century both in France and England, this sound {{IPA|/ts/}} de-affricated to {{IPA|/s/}}; and from that time 'c' has represented {{IPA|/s/}} before front vowels either for [[etymology|etymological]] reasons, as in ''lance, cent,'' or (in defiance of etymology){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} to avoid the ambiguity due to the \"etymological\" use of 's' for {{IPA|/z/}}, as in ''ace, mice, once, pence, defence''.\n\nThus, to show the etymology, English spelling has ''advise, devise,'' instead of ''advize, devize,'' which while ''advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice,'' etc., do not reflect etymology; example has extended this to ''hence, pence, defence,'' etc., where there is no etymological necessity for 'c'. Former generations also wrote ''{{lang|eng|sence}}'' for sense. Hence, today the [[Romance languages]] and [[English language|English]] have a common feature inherited from [[Vulgar Latin]] where 'c' takes on either a [[Hard and soft C|\"hard\" or \"soft\"]] value depending on the following vowel.\n\n==Use in orthographies==\n\n===English===\n\nIn [[English orthography]], 'c' generally represents a \"soft\" value of {{IPAc-en|s}} before the vowel letters 'e' (including the Latin-derived digraphs ae and oe), 'i' and 'y' and a \"hard\" value of {{IPAc-en|k}} before the vowel letters 'a', 'o' and 'u'. However, there are a number of exceptions in English: \"[[soccer]]\" and \"[[Pronunciation of Celtic|Celt]]\" are words that have {{IPAc-en|k}} where {{IPAc-en|s}} would be expected.\n\nThe soft c may represent the {{IPAc-en|\u0283}} sound in the digraph 'ci' when this precedes a vowel, as in the words 'delicious' and 'appreciate'.\n\nThe digraph '[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]' most commonly represents {{IPAc-en|t\u0283}}, but can take the value {{IPAc-en|k}} (mainly in words of [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] origin) or {{IPAc-en|\u0283}} (mainly in words of [[French language|French]] origin); some dialects of English also have {{IPAc-en|x}} in words like ''loch'' where other speakers pronounce the final sound as {{IPAc-en|k}}. The trigraph 'tch' always represents {{IPAc-en|t\u0283}}.\n\nThe digraph 'ck' is often used to represent the sound {{IPAc-en|k}}  after short vowels.\n\n===Other languages===\nIn the Romance languages [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], 'c' generally has a \"hard\" value of {{IPA|/k/}} and a \"soft\" value, the pronunciation of which varies by language. In French, Portuguese, and Spanish from Latin America and southern Spain, the soft 'c' value is {{IPA|/s/}} as it is in English.  In the Spanish spoken in northern and central Spain, the soft 'c' is a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. In [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the soft 'c' is {{IPA|[t\u0361\u0283]}}.\n\nAll [[Balto-Slavic languages]] that use the Latin alphabet, as well as [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], several [[Sami languages]], [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]], [[Ido language|Ido]], [[Interlingua language|Interlingua]], and [[Americanist phonetic notation]] (and those [[Indigenous languages of North America|aboriginal languages of North America]] whose practical orthography derives from it) use 'c' to represent {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}}, the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate|voiceless alveolar]] or [[voiceless dental sibilant affricate]]. In [[Pinyin|romanized]] [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the letter represents an aspirated version of this sound, {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02b0/}}.\n\nAmong non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, 'c' represents a variety of sounds. [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and a number of African languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], and [[Manding languages|Manding]] share the soft Italian value of {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}.  In [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Kurdish Language|Kurdish]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] 'c' stands for the voiced counterpart of this sound, the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}}. In [[Yabem language|Yabem]] and similar languages, such as [[Bukawa language|Bukawa]], 'c' stands for a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}. [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] use this letter to represent the click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}}. in some other African languages, such as Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], 'c' is used for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}. In [[Fijian language|Fijian]], 'c' stands for a [[voiced dental fricative]] {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}, while in [[Somali language|Somali]] it has the value of {{IPA|/[[Voiced pharyngeal fricative|\u0295]]/}}.\n\nThe letter 'c' is also used as a transliteration of the Cyrillic '\u0446' in the Latinic forms of [[Serbian alphabet|Serbian]], [[Romanisation of Macedonian|Macedonian]], and sometimes [[Romanization of Ukrainian|Ukrainian]] (along with the digraph 'ts').\n\n===Ch===\nThere are several common digraphs with 'c', the most common being '[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]', which in some languages such as [[German language|German]] is far more common than 'c' alone. 'Ch' takes various values in other languages, such as:\n* {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} in Spanish\n* {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in [[French language|French]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]\n* {{IPA|/k/}} in Interlingua and Italian\n* {{IPA|/x/}} in the [[West Slavic languages]] (e.g. [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]])\n* {{IPA|/x/}} (comprising the mostly [[Allophone|allophonic]] sounds {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e7]}}) or sometimes {{IPA|/k/}} in German\n* {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/\u03c7/}} in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]\n* {{IPA|/t\u0282\u02b0/}} in [[Pinyin|Romanized]] [[Standard Chinese]]\n\n===Other digraphs and trigraphs===\nAs in English, 'Ck', with the value {{IPA|/k/}}, is often used after short vowels in other [[Germanic languages]] such as German and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (but some other Germanic languages use 'kk' instead, such as Dutch and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]). The digraph 'cz' is found in Polish and 'cs' in Hungarian, both representing {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}. The digraph  'sc'  represents {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in Old English, Italian, and a few languages related to Italian, (however in Italian and related languages this only happens before front vowels, otherwise it represents {{IPA|/sk/}}). The trigraph 'sch' represents {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in German.\n\n==Other usage==\nAs a [[phonetic]] symbol, lowercase '{{IPA|c}}' is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and [[X-SAMPA]] symbol for the [[voiceless palatal plosive]], and capital 'C' is the X-SAMPA symbol for the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].\n\nIt is used to represent [[100 (number)|one hundred]] in [[Roman numerals]].\n\n==Related letters and other similar characters==\n{{Multicol}}\n*{{unicode|\u0106 \u0107}} : [[\u0106|Latin letter C with acute]]\n*{{unicode|\u0108 \u0109}} : [[\u0108|Latin letter C with circumflex]]\n*{{unicode|\u010c \u010d}} : [[\u010c|Latin letter C with caron]]\n*{{unicode|\u010a \u010b}} : [[\u010a|Latin letter C with dot above]]\n*\u00c7 \u00e7 : [[\u00c7|Latin letter C cedilla]]\n*{{Unicode|\u1e08 \u1e09}} : [[\u1e08|Latin letter C with cedilla and acute]]\n*{{unicode|\u0187 \u0188}} : [[\u0187|Latin letter C with hook]]\n*{{unicode|C\u0308 c\u0308}}: [[C\u0308|Latin letter C with diaresis]]\n*{{unicode|\u0255}} : [[\u0255|IPA symbol C with back-curl]]\n*\u0421 \u0441 : [[Es (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter Es]] \u2013 identical in shape with the Latin C c, but the equivalent of the Latin S s.\n*\u0426 \u0446 : [[Tse (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic letter Tse]]\n{{Multicol-break}}\n*{{unicode|\u216d}} : [[100 (number)|Roman numeral]]\n*{{unicode|\u0297}} : [[\u0297|stretched C]]\n*{{unicode|\u2102}} : [[\u2102|double struck C]]\n*{{unicode|\u212d}} : [[\u212d|blackletter C]]\n*{{unicode|\u2103}} : [[\u2103|degree Celsius]]\n*{{unicode|\u24b8 \u24d2}} : [[\u24b8|enclosed C]]\n*\u00a9 : [[\u00a9|copyright symbol]]\n*\u00a2 : [[\u00a2|cent (currency)]]\n*{{unicode|\u20a1}} : [[\u20a1|col\u00f3n (currency)]]\n*{{unicode|\u20a2}} : [[\u20a2|Brazilian cruzeiro (currency)]]\n*{{unicode|\u20b5}} : [[\u20b5|Ghana cedi (currency)]]\n{{Multicol-end}}\n\n==Computing codes==\n{{charmap\n| 0043 | 0063 | name1 = Latin Capital Letter C | name2 = &#160; Latin Small Letter C\n| map1 = [[EBCDIC]] family | map1char1 = C3 | map1char2 = 83\n| map2 = [[ASCII]] <sup>1</sup> | map2char1 = 43 | map2char2 = 63\n}}\n: <sup>1</sup> {{midsize|Also for encodings based on ASCII, including the DOS, Windows, ISO-8859 and Macintosh families of encodings.}}\n\n==Other representations==\n{{Letter other reps\n|NATO=Charlie\n|Morse=\u2013\u00b7\u2013\u00b7\n|Character=C3\n|Braille=\u2809\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hard and soft C]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|C}}\n*{{Commons-inline|C}}\n*{{Wiktionary-inline|C}}\n*{{Wiktionary-inline|c}}\n\n{{Latin alphabet|C|}}\n\n[[Category:ISO basic Latin letters]]"}]}}}}
